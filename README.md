# Life-Expectancy
Population and health data at the global, regional, and national levels are essential for monitoring progress in development and health for allocating resources. WHO (World Health Organisation) Global Health Estimates, provides a list of causes of death each year with comprehensive and comparable data. The primary goal of WHO includes the monitoring of global health trends, conditions, and factors. 
This project encapsulates the various factors affecting life expectancy in the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2019. EDA was conducted to concise the data accordingly to understand and analyze the data. The visuals depict the most affecting factors on mortality every year and also among the gender. The geographical distribution of these factors in all states was also observed. An interactive dashboard was created that summarises and analyses all the respective graphs.  The data shows mortality in females was more and BMI, life expectancy at birth, and preterm birth defects are the most important factors affecting the life expectancy rate in humans.
The dataset is collected from the source Kaggle. It is the collection of health data from the year 2000 to 2019 obtained from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) resource. The data includes different variables responsible for the life expectancy of a human and causes of mortality. Disease burden depicts the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health, which is calculated using disability-adjusted life year (DALY). It counts in different numbers for different diseases. The data is huge containing 147 columns and 1464 rows. The columns represent various attributes that serve as the factors responsible for affecting life expectancy.
